I'm a largely self-taught systems and frontend developer, game component creator, protocol wrangler and occasional UX designer.

I tend to design software with focus on how it interacts with people (both during development and after).

## What I do

| Current Project | Status |
|-|-|
| Helping out with issue management and research on [Bridgy Fed](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed) | ongoing |
| [*flourish*](https://crates.io/crates/flourish), an intuitive, type-erasable signals abstraction for Rust | released |
| Various [RPG Maker plugins](https://tamschi.itch.io/) | ongoing occasional releases |
| [Asteracea](https://blog.schichler.dev/posts/Asteracea), an efficient low-friction GUI framework in Rust | Technically working, but it's a lower priority yak-shave.<br>Infrequently yields useful OSS libraries. |

Additionally tech help for friends and family and keeping up with developments surrounding Rust, ActivityPub and ATProto in general.

## Things I wrote

- [Pinning in plain English](https://blog.schichler.dev/posts/Pinning-in-plain-English/)
  
  This was [generally well-received](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/pinning-in-plain-english/67992) and [translated into Chinese](https://zjp-cn.github.io/translation/Pinning-in-plain-English.html) by a member of the Rust community.  
  It also was on the Hacker News frontpage for a few hours.

- Rust RFC 3634: [Scoped `impl Trait for Type`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3634)

  This was a bit of a software design and technical writing exercise for myself.  
  The topic is quite complicated, so the overall document turned out longer than expected.  
  
  (This isn't currently actionable due to its size and a few issues that have only informal solutions in the discussion so far.  
  I plan to get back to it and work on breaking it down into a roadmap once I'm a bit less busy again.)
